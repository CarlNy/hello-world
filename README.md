Hi Dudes!

This is Carl here, I'm interested in developing and learning new emerging technologies, AWS Cloud, python programming, AI, IDE's, AR/VR.
I have been QA Software tester which has given me deeper understanding of software design ,applications and testing practice and realms.
I will finish off with this thought "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù George Orwald.
